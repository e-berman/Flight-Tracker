# Flight-Tracker

A flight finder that finds the cheapest one-way or round-trip flights.

Front-end is built with React.js and styled with Bootstrap. The backend is Node.js and MongoDB.

In order to procure cheap flight results, a trip type (one-way or round-trip), a departing and returning airport (in IATA format), and departing and return dates are needed.

Flight information is retrieved using the [Amadeus API](https://developers.amadeus.com/).

To Run, in separate terminal windows:

1. cd flight_tracker_react/ && npm install && npm start
2. cd flight_tracker_rest/ && npm install && npm start
