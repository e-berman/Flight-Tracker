# Flight-Tracker

A flight aggregator that utilizes Amadeus API for lowest prices flights. Gives the user the option to send the results to their email.

Also includes a separate microservice.py file that retrieves movie information from The Movie Database API for a group members project.

All required dependencies are listed in the README.md in both of the following directories:
- flight_tracker_react
- flight_tracker_rest

Instructions to run the Email Service are located in the README.md in the CS361_Email_Service directory.
